/**
 * This class is just an example of one way you could organize the data that you want
 * to send to the dashboard.  The PackAndSend method does all the work.  You could
 * put the packing code directly in your code, but this model protects you from
 * packing data in the wrong order throughout your code.
 * 
 * The data and the format of this structure are just an example.  It is written to
 * match the initial data format expected by the LabVIEW Dashboard project.  Feel free
 * to add data elements or remove them.  Just remember to make any changes consistently
 * between the LabVIEW "Dashboard Datatype" and the data that gets packed by this class.
